 <b><i>gear i used for school/productivity</i></b>
 <br><br>
 <p> over the years, i've carefully curated my list of technology to productivity oriented specifications, especially with my mobile phone. i've researched thoroughly through multiple people including james scholz and cal newport, two leading "dumb" phone reviewers.</p>
 <br>
 <p>ive also tested many dumbphones myself, being on a lightphone 2, while self-harm, is still a very good device for what i need.</p>
 <p><b> here is a list of devices i use for school in particular</b></p>
 <li> boox nova c</li>
 <li>light phone 2</li>
 <li>ipad (i used to use this mainly, but it really isn't all that great of a device and can be a cause of a distraction</li>
 <li> macbook air (running windows and mac os on two different partitions)</li>
 <li> onemore evo IEM headphones (wired iem's are scientifically better than wireless headphones)</li>

 <p> i love eink screens, james scholz was able to show me the fantastic world of them; however, the US has a stagnant production of them, meaning they are rarely used outside the standard kindle.</p>
 <p> eink screens are easier on the eyes and have the least amount of distractions on them which in turn allows for my productivity to prosper. that is exactly why i invested into the boox nova c, which had a student discount. </p>

<b><i>dumb phones ive tested: </i></b>

<p> these devices are used especially to lessen distractions and to allow me to be more intertwined with my day to day life, many of these are chosen due to their unique skillsets.</p>
<li> <b>samsung z flip 3: </b> honestly a little useless when i bought it; however i really enjoyed the fact that i was able to use the screen for multi applications so I could add the top screen for notes and the bottom for the slide show, a handy tool.  </li>
<br>
<li> <b>kyocera kyf31: </b> this device i figured out that imported phones have different bands, and due to this, they are supported by limited carriers or aren't supported at all, so i was unable to use the device. however, the functionality is there, and the way that the phone runs off of many applications and you can load many of them is very cool, and i will be buying another one as soon as they comeout with a new edition. </li>
<br>
<li> <b> light phone 2: </b> this phone is special to me, as i am still using it, however, the price point being 300 dollars is ridiculous, as the phone literally does not do anything outside of the normal eink screen. the fact that it has its own simcard and sim plan is unique, but the costly price of the plan itself is also really unsatisfying as a purchase. </li>
