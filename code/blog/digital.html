		Explaining the hindrance of utilizing distractions, specifically technology, involves looking at the benefits, so how would it benefit me? Thanks for asking, the main premise of technology was to allow information to be transported around the world and distribute information between the populace that utilize the format of different topics. If you needed information, google, if you need to catch up on peers and family, social media, if you needed to purchase something, amazon, the whole digital media market list can go on and on; however the main point is that these websites, every single one of them are calculated to MAXIMIZE your face time and the amount of screen time you use on these websites. It is a marketing scheme used to distract and purposefully scrutinize the positive correlations that technology brings us. The more that they can maximize your screen time, the more advertisements and b-rolls they can input in front of your screen, reprogramming your eyes to see them more actively and in front of what your main goal of accessing that particular website was going to be.

		Socrates once noted, “Memento Mori, you will die anyways”, a stoic term that references the involved need to live life every second you can, because you will, indefinitely die anyways. Screens have caused me negative effects in my life, grown socially awkward through my beginning years of education and stayed benignant, avoiding all confrontation and steered away from the so-called “friend groups” as I preferred to be alone. Why? Because technology was something I was so interested in; the growth from the original all-in-one computers to now, where we have hyper-processing graphics cards using vram that would sky-rocket the astounding original devices that are marked as a symbol for our generation. Where am I leading with this? Well, I do not believe that me being a lone star had a negative effect, in fact, I believe it was the most positive time in my life. However, it did not turn bad until the introduction of two main things: social media and digital marketing.

		Social media became a popular topic within the educational social paradigm. Many people had Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, et cetera; however, when I was introduced into this space, I had abused it whole-heartedly. Posting anything I can, showing any part of my personal life that would showcase to my peers that I, myself, were not the boring individual that many had sought me to be. Self perseverance had been stopped, and I was putting every part of my personal life on these websites until I did not have anything else to show. I did this, from middle school, till highschool, then accumulated the frustration and until my sophomore year of my collegiate career, had invested into digital minimalism. I will speak about this later in this excerpt.

		Digital marketing, as denounced earlier, is the formula of how long can websites keep you intertwined in looking at your screen, while showcasing as many advertisements as possible. A pyramid scheme that involves many moving factors, however, as the user accessing a page, realizing this formula means we are forced to partake into a scheme that is introduced to us organically and allows the sole benefiter, the webmasters, to gain revenue. What do we, as a people, gain from this interaction? A rewiring of our internal compass. To further explain, we are turning to abusing technology instead of utilizing technology properly means not relying solely on the social aspects that eventually lead to the draining of many people's mental health and distractions that cause failure within a society, whether it's through education or a workplace.</p>
<p>While digital marketing may be beneficial for businesses, it can be detrimental to users' mental health and productivity. By constantly bombarding users with distractions, it can cause them to lose focus on important tasks and waste valuable time. It can also contribute to a sense of information overload, leading to feelings of anxiety and stress.</p>
