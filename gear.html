 <b><i>gear i used for school/productivity</i></b>
 <br><br>
 <p> over the years, i've carefully curated my list of technology to productivity oriented specifications, especially with my mobile phone. i've researched thoroughly through multiple people including james scholz and cal newport, two leading "dumb" phone reviewers.</p>
 <br>
 <p>ive also tested many dumbphones myself, being on a lightphone 2, while self-harm, is still a very good device for what i need.</p>
 <p><b> here is a list of devices i use for school in particular</b></p>
 <li> boox nova c</li>
 <li>light phone 2</li>
 <li>ipad (i used to use this mainly, but it really isn't all that great of a device and can be a cause of a distraction</li>
 <li> macbook air (running windows and mac os on two different partitions)</li>
 <li> onemore evo IEM headphones (wired iem's are scientifically better than wireless headphones)</li>

 <p> i love eink screens, james scholz was able to show me the fantastic world of them; however, the US has a stagnant production of them, meaning they are rarely used outside the standard kindle.</p>
